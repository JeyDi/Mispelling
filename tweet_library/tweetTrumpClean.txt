Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017 Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team they all stood up for our National Anthem Big progress being made-we all love our country!
The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard Great anger
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing &amp Replacing O'Care My oh my has he changed-complete‚Ä¶ 
owed to Wall Street and the banks which sadly must be dealt with Food water and medical are top priorities - and doing well FEMA
It's old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated Much of the Island was destroyed with billions of dollars

Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country

General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!

The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night Important meetings taking place today Big tax cuts &amp reform
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem NFL must respect this!
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total) These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
Making America Safe is my number one priority We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet

Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country NFL should change policy!
Alaska Arizona Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal 7 years of Repeal &amp Replace and some Senators not there
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
RT @DonnaWR8: @realDonaldTrump I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our Anthem?‚Ä¶
RT @DonnaWR8: @realDonaldTrump You can boycott our anthem 

WE CAN BOYCOTT YOU! 

NFL MAGA 
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony Great team!
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable Bad ratings!
NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country League should back US
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp Country you will see change take place fast Fire or suspend!
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won't be around much longer!
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our countryTell them to stand!
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage" Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived 116% increase!
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching IsraelThey are also working with North KoreaNot much of an agreement we have!
Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS) She is a truly great representative for our country! 
our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem If not YOU'RE FIRED Find something else to do!
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship teamStephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama What great people what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday
Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare worst in the country Deductibles high people angry! Lisa M comes through
I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do Better control &amp  management Great for Arizona McCain let his best friend LG down!
Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year with deductibles very high Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods Sad
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves He campaigned on Repeal &amp Replace Let Arizona down!

This will be a very interesting day for HealthCareThe Dems are obstructionists but the Republicans can have a great victory for the people!
Working on major Trade Deal with the United Kingdom Could be very big &amp exciting JOBS! The EU is very protectionist with the US STOP!
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians Witch Hunt Next up 11 year old Barron Trump!
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote Brave - American hero! Thank you John
ObamaCare is torturing the American PeopleThe Democrats have fooled the people long enough Repeal or Repeal &amp Replace! I have pen in hand
Big day for HealthCare After 7 years of talking we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI &amp the person in charge of the Hillary investigation Andrew McCabe got $700000 from H for wife!
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails &amp DNC server) &amp Intel leakers!
Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton" So where is the investigation AG @seanhannity
Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?
So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?
The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive dangerous and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad

Remarks‚Ä¶ 
Arriving at Joint Base Andrews with @SecretaryPerry @SecretaryZinke and @SecPriceMD 
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal &amp Replace after years of talking &amp campaigning on it
Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
So why aren't the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered AG looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp Russia relations?
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia"
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News!
Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+ SCreg cuttingStock M jobsborder etc = TRUE!
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive is bad!
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians!

In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci he wanted to endorse me 1st before the Republican Primaries started but didn't think I was running!
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp acid washed) her 33000 e-mails!
What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company Uranium deal Russian Reset big dollar speeches etc
So many people are asking why isn't the AG or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes 33000 e-mails deleted?
While all agree the U S President has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against usFAKE NEWS

The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!

The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes Even parts of full Repeal need 60 8 Dems control Senate Crazy!
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House &amp Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan Stay tuned!
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans Most Republicans were loyal terrific &amp worked really hard We will return!
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate Dems will join in!
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent That's politics!

Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp burn!
under a magnifying glass they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding There is no collusion &amp no obstruction I should be given apology!
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling With 4 months looking at Russia
and did not want to "rock the boat" He didn't "choke" he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas All they do is delay and complainThey own ObamaCare!
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
